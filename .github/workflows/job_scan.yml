# TPM Job Scanning Agent
# Runs twice daily and emails a digest of new TPM openings at AI companies.
#
# Required secrets (repo Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):
#   EMAIL_USER      your Outlook address (sender), e.g. rathir1@outlook.com
#   EMAIL_PASSWORD  your Outlook account password (or app password if MFA enabled)
#   EMAIL_TO        recipient email address
#
# DB persistence: jobs_seen.db is committed back to the repo after each run
# so the dedup store survives across workflow runs. The commit uses [skip ci]
# to prevent a trigger loop. Only commits when new jobs are found.
